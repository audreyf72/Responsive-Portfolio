    <p>  
        One day I realized I was falling behind. Technology has been racing ahead at full speed while I’ve just been floating along thinking I’m keeping up. It was an unpleasant phone call with GoDaddy tech support that made me realize I’m not comfortable being the technologically handicapped person this person made me out to be.

        So here I am, bound and determined not be become obsolete. On the contrary, I plan to put myself right on the cutting-edge, with the skills of a full stack developer and an experienced graphic designer. The potential for this experience to prove life changing is pretty good and, I admit, I’m approaching it with some trepidation.

        But as long as I have my coffee first, I’m good.
