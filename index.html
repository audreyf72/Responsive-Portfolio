                    My day begins with coffee. Every day, one 10 oz. cup of coffee at my kitchen counter 
                    while I check my emails and read the headlines. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t 
                    start my day this way. Of course, I wasn’t always checking emails and headlines on my 
                    iPad. It used to be newspapers and magazines spread across the counter while I drank 
                    my coffee. I suppose the coffee has changed too. I drink it stronger now and without 
                    sugar. But the routine has always been the same, coffee first then prepare for the day. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                     My days have been equally routine. For 15 years I’ve been working as an Art Director 
                     for a Screen Printer in Huntington Beach. I handle all design work, oversee customer 
                     supplied artwork, and maintain the company web sites. It’s easy work and low stress 
                     so it’s been an ideal arrangement for my cautious disposition. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>   
                     One day I realized I was falling behind. Technology has been racing ahead at full 
                     speed while I’ve just been floating along thinking I’m keeping up. It was an unpleasant 
                     phone call with GoDaddy tech support that made me realize I’m not comfortable being the 
                     technologically handicapped person this person made me out to be. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                     So here I am, bound and determined not be become obsolete. On the contrary, I plan to 
                     put myself right on the cutting-edge, with the skills of a full stack developer and an 
                     experienced graphic designer. The potential for this experience to prove life changing 
                     is pretty good and, I admit, I’m approaching it with some trepidation. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                     But as long as I have my coffee first, I’m good.
